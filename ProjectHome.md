A cross platform Python implementation of WS-Discovery as described in the specification draft at http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/04/discovery/.

WS-Discovery is used as a web services discovery protocol which is implemented using UDP multicasting and XML SOAP/UDP (http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2004/09/soap-over-udp/) specifications.

This is used in many discovery related scenarios and web services profiles such as DPWS (Devices Profile for Web Services)
